<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I want to study web server programming so i can serve up some websites. Web apps are awesome because you don't have to worry much about software/hardware requirements of your end users.</p>
<h2>Business Role</h2>
<p>Web server programming helps businesses serve their clients through websites. Many businesses operate almost entirely through web applications. It makes it easy to provide users with a GUI to interact with your internal data and functions.</p>
<h2>Where's It Going?</h2>
<p>In short, it's going nowhere. I think the only big change coming is part of the movement to mobile. Web programming allows functionality and interfaces to be (extremely) easy to port to Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android, and really anything with a web browser.</p>
